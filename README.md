# simpler-portofolio

This portofolio is much more simpler prior to my-portofolio because I wanted to use the basic html-css-js first before jumping in to use all the framework that is available to create a more dynamic website filled with animation. In other word, this is a quicker project so I can launch it (I don't have any now)
